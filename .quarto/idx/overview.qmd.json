To create a quarto document, you just need to give it the correct extension (`qmd`).\n\nQuarto can render multiple formats on Visual Studio Code (pdf, html, word etc.)\nIn addition to that, it is possible in a Quarto file to render a Jupyter Notebook as a `.qmd` file or `.ipynb` file.\n\nWe will later on, cover how specifically we [preview]() and [render]() files with Quarto on VS Code.\n\n## RStudio\n\nThe minimal version of R Studio that has support to Quarto is `RStudio v2022.07`. Later versions of R Studio are also good candidates. We will not go through the [installation](https://cran.rstudio.com/) of RStudio itself. We assume you to understand how it is done.\n\n### Creating documents\n\nTo create a Quarto document, you go to: `File:New file: Quarto Document`.\nAnd again for a Quarto Presentation, you select the appropriate button `Quarto Presentation`.\n\n<img src=\"img/illustration_create_new_quarto_doc_rstudio.png\" alt=\"Illustration create new quarto document on R studio\"  class=\"img-illu-quarto rstudio\">\n\nWe will, later on, cover how specifically we [preview]() and [render]() files with Quarto on RStudio.\n\n## Jupyter Lab\n\nJupyter Lab is a little bit different because we use it to create `.ipynb` files. But Quarto is integrated in Jupyter Lab so that it is possible to write YAML options to knit a notebook.\nHere we do not need to create a `.qmd` file since it will knited to our desired format anyway\n\nThe code, we are going to be kniting into a html format (It is also possible to knit it to other formats):\n<img src=\"img/illustration_demo_quarto_jupyterlab.png\" alt=\"Illustration demo quarto on Jupyter lab\"  class=\"img-illu-quarto demo-jupyterlab\">\n\nThis is the code used by Quarto site themselves.\n\nAs you can see, we created a YAML header first like in any `.qmd` file and then we we wrote down markdown code befor our python chunk. We will, later on, cover how to preview and render those files on Juypterlab.\n\n## Neovim\n\nIn Neovim, you can just create a new `.qmd` like in RStudio and the write basic quarto code.\nHere is what the UI should look like:\n\n<img src=\"img/illustration_demo_quarto_neovim.png\" alt=\"Illustration demo quarto on Neovim\"  class=\"img-illu-quarto demo-neovim\">\n\nNeovim's case is a little bit special.
